in this lesson we will learn how to create a variable in asm 

in assembly we cant display numbers directly using interupt 16 
we display char only using their ascii 

but in register the numbers are there so we can apply any arithmetic operation 



HOW T OCREATE A VAR 


var ===> a resrved mem location with some name 


always create var before padding statement 

padding should be end of file 





syntax  t ocreate variable 


varname : 
db 0x12


db ==> defined byte ==> 1 byte ==> 8bit == >we can save data of 8 bit 0x00 to 0xff   ==> in decimal 0 to 2power8 -1==> 255  

but it may casue an erro 


eg 255 ==> 1111 1111    ++ > msb 1 ==> -ve ==> 2s complement 

256 ===>  1 0000 0000    ===> overflow ===> actual number in register ==== 0 

256 + 65 ==> points to 65 ==>  A




dw ===> defined words ==> big endian 
word==> 2 byte ==> 8-8bit ==> 2 cell in ram 

as mem location block is of 8 but 

dw ==> will write datain 2 consecutive me m cell 

dw 0xaa55 

0xabcd  ===> 0x55
0xabce  ===> 0xaa
big endian 





dw 0xaa55  ===> db 0x55 db 0xaa 

allowed 



varname : 
db 0x11
db 0x13
db 0x14


[varname]==> 0x11
[varname + 1 ]==> 0x13
[varname + 2 ]==> 0x14
