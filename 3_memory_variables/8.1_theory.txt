basically in this page we will learn is 0z1234 is absolute adress in ram , or relative or what it is ???



when we write [0x1234] ==> value at 
it will we used t osave value at that mem location or retrive from that location 


ds register ==> default segment 


when our program loads in ram , binary file , machine ubnderatnable code , we load it in ram 

all binary code get moved to a 0x7c00  in ram 

first line of instruction is at 0x7c00 and so on 


by default ds will set to 0x7c00  

mov [0x1234] 44  


===>    0x7c00 *16  + 0x1234   , it is exact location in ram where are saving the 14 

similary if we retrive the data from [0x1234]===> it will add ds*16


this thing is happening automattically 


we can set ds explicitly 






[0x1234]  hai ===>   ds register * 16 automatically add hoga hi hoga
