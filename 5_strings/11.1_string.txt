Creating strings in assembly language 

as we are working with variable so set the org correctly to 0x7c00 



my_string : 
   db 'hello_world' ,  0  



it will save each character in each memory cell 


h 
e 
l 
l 
o 
0 

0 ==> end of string 

to acess string 

h ==> [my_string + 0 ]
e ==> [my_string + 1 ]
l ==> [my_string + 2 ]
l ==> [my_string + 3 ]
o ==> [my_string  + 4 ]
0 ===>   [my_string  + 5 ]

0 will also present in ram 

if we are saming number in var , we can define it anywhere 

if we are defining string , char in var , define it just above jmp $ , use address of var , should be below where it is accessed
